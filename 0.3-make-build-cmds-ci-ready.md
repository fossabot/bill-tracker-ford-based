Goal: One consistent set of commands that both GitHub Actions and Tekton run.



Add Gradle tasks and conventions:

* ./gradlew test

* ./gradlew check (linting later if you add it)

* ./gradlew sonar (but only in CI with env vars)

Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow that runs:

* test

* sonar

* fossa analyze

Before we do 0.3, do this tiny alignment check:

Quick check

1. Confirm you have this file committed:

* backend/src/main/resources/application.properties

2. Confirm application-local.properties is ignored by git.


    * git status
